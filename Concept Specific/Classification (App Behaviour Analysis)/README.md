### Directing customers to subscription through app-behavior analysis

Comapnies need to know who to target with offers and promotions.
```
> Market - 
> Product - 
> Goal - 

```

The company doesn't want to target all the customers with offers, especially the ones who were anyway going to buy the product.

```
> Date, time of app installation
> engaged features in app
> app screens the user looked at
> App usage data is available for first day only (Free trial is valid only for 24 hours).
```
